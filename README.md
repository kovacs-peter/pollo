# üêì POLLO üêì

Pollo is a simple application. Pollo doesn't want to change the world. Pollo only want's to provide an easy way to create a simple poll and share it with friends, so you can decide where you'll go for dinner or what film will you watch.

## About The Project

The app is a serverless React application utilizing Firebase as an auth provider and Firestore as a database and deployed on [Render.com](https://render.com). When a user logs in the credentials are stored in local storage, meaning when you access the site from another device, your auth data is lost. State is managed three different way. Firebase itself for user authentication, redux-toolkit for the userdata and react queries for the polls.

### Why don't we use an authprovider?

The main driver of this project was simplicity, so setting up user - password authentication wasn't on the table. Using for eg. Google's auth provider would solve the issue with login persistence across browsers but Google doesn't let it's Oauth service work in webviews (FB messenger's inapp browser) where this app makes the most sense. So anonymous login it is.
